# The-Sleeping-Teaching-Assistant
A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) who helps undergraduate students with their programming assignments during regular office hours.
The role of a teaching assistant(TA) is vital in providing academic support to
students. In this project, aim is to simulate an office where students come seeking help
from the TA. The office has a limited number of chairs for students to wait, and the
TA can assist only one student at a time. If all the chairs are occupied, the student
must wait outside until a chair becomes available.
